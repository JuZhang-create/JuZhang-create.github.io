My research lies in algebraic graph theory, especially the study of symmetry in graphs via group actions.

## Token Graphs

For a graph $G$, the $k$-token graph $F_k(G)$ is a graph whose vertices correspond to $k$-subsets of $V(G)$. Token graphs encode combinatorial and structural information of the original graph in a higher-dimensional configuration space.

I study automorphism groups of token graphs and investigate when $\mathrm{Aut}(F_k(G))$ is determined by $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$. Particular attention is given to Hamming graphs and highly symmetric graphs.

## Strongly Regular Graphs

I am interested in structural properties of strongly regular graphs, especially the case $\mu=2$.  
My work focuses on:

- clique geometry
- complements of strongly regular graphs
- local structures determined by common neighbours
- grid graphs $K_n \square K_n$

These problems are closely connected to finite permutation groups and rank-3 group actions.

## Symmetry and Permutation Groups

Many combinatorial structures can be understood via group actions.  
I study how graph symmetries reflect properties of permutation groups, particularly:

- vertex-transitive graphs
- edge-transitive graphs
- automorphism groups of derived graphs
